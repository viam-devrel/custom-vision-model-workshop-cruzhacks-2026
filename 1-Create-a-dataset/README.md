# Create a dataset

To train a custom model based on your images, you'll need a dataset the LiteRT framework (previously known as TensorFlow Lite) can use. So we'll create a dataset to start this workshop.

1. In the Viam app, go to the [DATA](https://app.viam.com/data) tab. Be sure you are in the right organization (if you have more than one; click on the top-right menu and select the one you intend to use if not already there).
1. You'll be brought to an overview of any data you have captured for this org, separated bv type. there may not be any data initially, but we'll be changing that soon! 
1. Click on **DATASETS**, then click **Create dataset**. An input will appear; give your dataset a descriptive name, for example `beverages`. Click **Create dataset** again to save.
1. You now have a dataset that can be used to logically group any images capture from your rover.
